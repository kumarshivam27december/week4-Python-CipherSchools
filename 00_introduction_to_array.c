/*
WHAT IS AN ARRAY ?

=> instead of intialising so many variable we just use an array


=> collection of same data type variable (or homogenous)

=> hetrogenous is structure 

=> array is continous memory location

=>c c++ not strict in type and size checking language
    i.e index out of range nahi hoga it will give some 
    garbage value instead depending on the compiler
